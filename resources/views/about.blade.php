ParagraphParagraphs are the group of sentences combined together, about a
certain topic. It is a very important form of writing as we write almost everything
in paragraphs, be it an answer, essay, story, emails, etc. We can say that a well-structured
paragraph is the essence of good writing. The purposes of the paragraph are to give information,
to explain something, to tell a story, and to convince someone that our idea is right.
